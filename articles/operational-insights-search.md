# Operational Insights Search
At the core of Microsoft Azure Operational Insights is our search feature which allows you to combine and correlate any machine data from multiple sources within your environment. Intelligence Packs are also powered by search to bring you metrics pivoted around a particular problem area.


## Search for data
You can use the **Search** feature in Azure Operational Insights to find the data that you’re looking for.

On the **Search** page, you can create a query, and then when you search, you can filter the results by using facet controls. You can also create advanced queries to transform, filter, and report on your results.

Common search queries appear on most search pages. Throughout the Operational Insights console, you can click tiles or drill in to other items to view details about the item by using **Search**.
You can use facets and filter controls to narrow your results. Assisted typing with autocomplete helps you learn the syntax and produces results quickly.
