#Get started with Azure Search in NodeJS#

This page is a placeholder for a new tutorial and sample that demonstrates how to code with Azure Search in NodeJS. Actual content will be published within the next few days.

[Download the finished sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=530198) to see a working example of NodeJS code that calls the Azure Search REST APIs.

As a temporary workaround, consider this alternative tutorial, [Get started with Azure Search in .NET](../search-get-started-dotnet/), to learn the fundamentals of programming with Azure Search.
