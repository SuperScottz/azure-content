# Using Diagnostic Search in Application Insights

Diagnostic Search is the blade in [Application Insights][start] that you use to find and explore individual telemetry items, such as page views, exceptions, or web requests. And you can view log traces and events that you have coded.

## When do you see Diagnostic Search?

You can open diagnostic search explicitly:

![Open diagnostic search](./media/app-insights-diagnostic-search/01-open-Diagnostic.png)


It also opens when you click through some charts and grid items. In this case, its filters are pre-set to focus on the type of item you selected. 

For example, if your application is a web service, the overview blade shows a chart of volume of requests. Click it and you get to a more detailed chart, with a listing showing how many requests have been made for each URL. Click any row, and you get a list of the individual requests for that URL:

![Open diagnostic search](./media/app-insights-diagnostic-search/07-open-from-filters.png)


The main body of Diagnostic Search is a list of telemetry items - server requests, page views, custom events that you have coded, and so on. At the top of the list is a summary chart showing counts of events over time.


## Inspect individual items

Select any telemetry item to see key fields and related items. If you want to see the full set of fields, click "...". 

![Open diagnostic search](./media/app-insights-diagnostic-search/10-detail.png)

To find the full set of fields, use plain strings (without wildcards). The available fields depend on the type of telemetry.

## Filter event types

Open the Filter blade and choose the event types you want to see. (If, later, you want to restore the filters with which you opened the blade, click Reset.)


![Choose Filter and select telemetry types](./media/app-insights-diagnostic-search/02-filter-req.png)


The event types are:

* **Trace** - Diagnostic logs including TrackTrace,  log4Net, NLog, and System.Diagnostic.Trace calls.
* **Request** - HTTP requests received by your server application, including pages, scripts, images, style files and data. These events are used to create the request and response overview charts.
* **Page View** - Telemetry sent by the web client, used to create page view reports. 
* **Custom Event** - If you inserted calls to TrackEvent() in order to [monitor usage][track], you can search them here.
* **Exception** - Uncaught exceptions in the server, and those that you log by using TrackException().

## Filter on property values

You can filter events on the values of their properties. The available properties depend on the event types you selected. 

For example, pick out requests with a specific response code.

![Expand a property and choose a value](./media/app-insights-diagnostic-search/03-response500.png)

Choosing no values of a particular property has the same effect as choosing all values; it switches off filtering on that property.


### Narrow your search

Notice that the counts to the right of the filter values show how many occurrences there are in the current filtered set. 

In this example, it's clear that the Order/Payment request results in the majority of the 500 errors:

![Expand a property and choose a value](./media/app-insights-diagnostic-search/04-failingReq.png)

## Inspect individual occurrences

Add that request name to the filter set, and you can then inspect individual occurrences of that event.

![Select a value](./media/app-insights-diagnostic-search/05-reqDetails.png)

For Request events, the details show exceptions that occurred while the request was being processed.

Click through an exception to see its detail.

![Click an exception](./media/app-insights-diagnostic-search/06-callStack.png)


## <a name="search"></a>Search the data

You can search for terms in any of the property values. This is particularly useful if you have written [custom events][track] with property values. 

You might want to set a time range, as searches over a shorter range are faster. 

![Open diagnostic search](./media/appinsights/appinsights-311search.png)

Search for terms, not substrings. Terms are alphanumeric strings including some punctuation such as '.' and '_'. For example:

<table>
  <tr><th>term</th><th>is NOT matched by</th><th>but these do match</th></tr>
  <tr><td>HomeController.About</td><td>about<br/>home</td><td>h*about<br/>home*</td></tr>
  <tr><td>IsLocal</td><td>local<br/>is<br/>*local</td><td>isl*<br/>islocal<br/>i*l</td></tr>
  <tr><td>New Delay</td><td>w d</td><td>new<br/>delay<br/>n* AND d*</td></tr>
</table>

Here are the search expressions you can use:

<table>
                    <tr>
                      <th>
                        <p>Sample query</p>
                      </th>
                      <th>
                        <p>Effect</p>
                      </th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td>
                        <p>
                          <span class="code">slow</span>
                        </p>
                      </td>
                      <td>
                        <p>Find all events in the date range whose fields include the term "slow"</p>
                      </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>

                      </td>
                      <td>

                      </td>
                    </tr>
                     <tr>
                      <td>

                      </td>

## Save your search

When you've set all the filters you want, you can save the search as a favorite:

![](./media/app-insights-diagnostic-search/08-favorite-save.png)


To see it again, **go to the overview blade** and open Favorites:

## Send more telemetry to Application Insights

In addition to the out-of-the-box telemetry sent by Application Insights SDK, you can:

* Capture log traces from your favorite logging framework. This means you can search through your log traces and correlate them with page views, exceptions, and other events. 
* Write code to send custom events, page views, and exceptions. 

[Learn how to send logs and custom telemetry to Application Insights][trace].


## <a name="questions"></a>Q & A

### <a name="limits"></a>How much data is retained?

Up to 500 events per second from each application. Events are retained for seven days.
