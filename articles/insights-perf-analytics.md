# Performance analytics for Web Apps

After enabling the Azure web app extension (detailed steps below) youâ€™ll be able to see statistics and details on the application dependencies of your web app in Microsoft Azure App Service.  These application dependencies are automatically discovered. 

Here's an example that shows the amount of time spent in a SQL dependency including the number of SQL calls and related statistics such as the average duration and standard deviation.

## Set up Performance Analytics

#### 1. Add Visual Studio Application Insights to your Visual Studio project

In your project in Visual Studio 2013 Update 3 or later, add Application Insights to your project.

![In Solution Explorer, right-click your project and choose Add Application Insights](./media/insights-perf-analytics/03-add.png)

Or if you're creating a new project, just make sure to check the Application Insights option:

![In the New Project dialog, check Add Application Insights](./media/insights-perf-analytics/04-new.png)


When you're asked to login, use the credentials for your Azure account.

#### 2. Enable Application Insights in your Azure website

Enable the Application Insights Extension on the Azure web site blade (not the Application Insight blade):

![In your Azure website blade, click Extensions. In the Extensions blade, click Add, then Choose Extension, then Application Insights](./media/insights-perf-analytics/05-extend.png)

*Can I automate this step?*

Yes, there's a REST API for Azure websites. In PowerShell:

    $extension = "https://<sitename>.scm.azurewebsites.net/api/siteextensions/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AzureWebSites"
    Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $extension -Headers @{Authorization=("Basic {0}" -f $base64AuthInfo)} -Method PUT -Verbose



## Explore the data

Use your website for a while to generate some data.

Then refresh your Application Insights blade and scroll down to the performance lens.

![Click Refresh](./media/insights-perf-analytics/06-overview.png)

Drill into the first or second chart to see your code dependencies:

![Click a chart to see more detail](./media/insights-perf-analytics/07-dependency.png)

Drill through to see individual requests:

![In the grid, click a dependency to see related requests.](./media/insights-perf-analytics/08-requests.png)
