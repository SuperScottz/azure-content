# Add push notifications to your Mobile Services app

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-selector-get-started-push](../includes/mobile-services-selector-get-started-push.md)]

This topic shows you how to use Azure Mobile Services to send push notifications to a Xamarin.Android app. In this tutorial you add push notifications using the Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) service to the [Get started with Mobile Services] project. When complete, your mobile service will send a push notification each time a record is inserted.

This tutorial walks you through these basic steps to enable push notifications:

1. [Enable Google Cloud Messaging](#register)
2. [Configure Mobile Services](#configure)
3. [Configure the project for push notifications](#configure-app)
3. [Add push notifications code to your app](#add-push)
4. [Update scripts to send push notifications](#update-scripts)
5. [Insert data to receive notifications](#test)

This tutorial requires the following:

+ An active Google account.
+ [Google Cloud Messaging Client Component]. You will add this component during the tutorial.

You should already have the [Xamarin.Android] and [Azure Mobile Services][Azure Mobile Services Component] components installed in your project from when you completed either [Get started with Mobile Services] or [Add Mobile Services to an existing app].

##<a id="register"></a>Enable Google Cloud Messaging

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-enable-Google-cloud-messaging](../includes/mobile-services-enable-Google-cloud-messaging.md)]

##<a id="configure"></a>Configure Mobile Services to send push requests

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-android-configure-push](../includes/mobile-services-android-configure-push.md)]

##<a id="configure-app"></a>Configure the existing project for push notifications

1. In the Solution view, expand the **Components** folder in the Xamarin.Android app and make sure that Azure Mobile Services package is installed. 

2. Right-click the **Components** folder, click  **Get More Components...**, search for the **Google Cloud Messaging Client** component and add it to the project. 

1. Open the ToDoActivity.cs project file and add the following using statement to the class:

		using Gcm.Client;

2. In the **ToDoActivity** class, add the following new code: 

        // Create a new instance field for this activity.
        static ToDoActivity instance = new ToDoActivity();

        // Return the current activity instance.
        public static ToDoActivity CurrentActivity
        {
            get
            {
                return instance;
            }
        }
        // Return the Mobile Services client.
        public MobileServiceClient CurrentClient
        {
            get
            {
                return client;
            }
        }

	This enables you to access the Mobile Services client instance from the service process.

3. Change the existing Mobile Services client declaration to public, as follows:

		public MobileServiceClient client { get; private set; }

4.	Add the following code to the **OnCreate** method, after the **MobileServiceClient** is created:

        // Set the current instance of TodoActivity.
        instance = this;

        // Make sure the GCM client is set up correctly.
        GcmClient.CheckDevice(this);
        GcmClient.CheckManifest(this);

        // Register the app for push notifications.
        GcmClient.Register(this, ToDoBroadcastReceiver.senderIDs);

Your **ToDoActivity** is now prepared for adding push notifications.

##<a id="add-push"></a>Add push notifications code to your app

4. Create a new class in the project called `ToDoBroadcastReceiver`.

5. Add the following using statements to **ToDoBroadcastReceiver** class:

		using Gcm.Client;
		using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.MobileServices;

6. Add the following permission requests between the **using** statements and the **namespace** declaration:

		[assembly: Permission(Name = "@PACKAGE_NAME@.permission.C2D_MESSAGE")]
		[assembly: UsesPermission(Name = "@PACKAGE_NAME@.permission.C2D_MESSAGE")]
		[assembly: UsesPermission(Name = "com.google.android.c2dm.permission.RECEIVE")]

		//GET_ACCOUNTS is only needed for android versions 4.0.3 and below
		[assembly: UsesPermission(Name = "android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS")]
		[assembly: UsesPermission(Name = "android.permission.INTERNET")]
		[assembly: UsesPermission(Name = "android.permission.WAKE_LOCK")]

7. Replace the existing **ToDoBroadcastReceiver** class definition with the following:
 
	    [BroadcastReceiver(Permission = Gcm.Client.Constants.PERMISSION_GCM_INTENTS)]
	    [IntentFilter(new string[] { Gcm.Client.Constants.INTENT_FROM_GCM_MESSAGE }, 
	        Categories = new string[] { "@PACKAGE_NAME@" })]
	    [IntentFilter(new string[] { Gcm.Client.Constants.INTENT_FROM_GCM_REGISTRATION_CALLBACK }, 
	        Categories = new string[] { "@PACKAGE_NAME@" })]
	    [IntentFilter(new string[] { Gcm.Client.Constants.INTENT_FROM_GCM_LIBRARY_RETRY }, 
        Categories = new string[] { "@PACKAGE_NAME@" })]
        public class ToDoBroadcastReceiver : GcmBroadcastReceiverBase<GcmService>
        {
	        // Set the Google app ID.
	        public static string[] senderIDs = new string[] { "<PROJECT_NUMBER>" };
        }

	In the above code, you must replace _`<PROJECT_NUMBER>`_ with the project number assigned by Google when you provisioned your app in the Google developer portal. 

8. In the ToDoBroadcastReceiver.cs project file, add the following code that defines the **PushHandlerService** class:
 
		// The ServiceAttribute must be applied to the class.
    	[Service] 
    	public class PushHandlerService : GcmServiceBase
    	{
        	public static string RegistrationID { get; private set; }
 
        	public PushHandlerService() : base(ToDoBroadcastReceiver.senderIDs) { }
    	}

	Note that this class derives from **GcmServiceBase** and that the **Service** attribute must be applied to this class.

	>[AZURE.NOTE]The **GcmServiceBase** class implements the **OnRegistered()**, **OnUnRegistered()**, **OnMessage()** and **OnError()** methods. You must override these methods in the **PushHandlerService** class.

5. Add the following code to the **ToDoBroadcastReceiver** class that overrides the **OnRegistered** event handler. 

        protected override void OnRegistered(Context context, string registrationId)
        {
            System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("The device has been registered with GCM.", "Success!");
            
            // Get the MobileServiceClient from the current activity instance.
            MobileServiceClient client = ToDoActivity.CurrentActivity.CurrentClient;           
            var push = client.GetPush();

            List<string> tags = null;

            //// (Optional) Uncomment to add tags to the registration.
            //var tags = new List<string>() { "myTag" }; // create tags if you want

            try
            {
                // Make sure we run the registration on the same thread as the activity, 
                // to avoid threading errors.
                ToDoActivity.CurrentActivity.RunOnUiThread(
                    async () => await push.RegisterNativeAsync(registrationId, tags));
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(
                    string.Format("Error with Azure push registration: {0}", ex.Message));                
            }
        }

	This method uses the returned GCM registration ID to register with Azure for push notifications.

10. Override the **OnMessage** method in **PushHandlerService** with the following code:

        protected override void OnMessage(Context context, Intent intent)
        {          
            string message = string.Empty;

            // Extract the push notification message from the intent.
            if (intent.Extras.ContainsKey("message"))
            {
                message = intent.Extras.Get("message").ToString();
                var title = "New item added:";

                // Create a notification manager to send the notification.
                var notificationManager = 
                    GetSystemService(Context.NotificationService) as NotificationManager;

                // Create a new intent to show the notification in the UI. 
                PendingIntent contentIntent = 
					PendingIntent.GetActivity(context, 0, 
					new Intent(this, typeof(ToDoActivity)), 0);	          

                // Create the notification using the builder.
                var builder = new Notification.Builder(context);
                builder.SetAutoCancel(true);
                builder.SetContentTitle(title);
                builder.SetContentText(message);
                builder.SetSmallIcon(Resource.Drawable.ic_launcher);
                builder.SetContentIntent(contentIntent);
                var notification = builder.Build();

                // Display the notification in the Notifications Area.
                notificationManager.Notify(1, notification);

            }
        }

12. Add the following method overrides for **OnUnRegistered()** and **OnError()**, which are required for the project to compile.

        protected override void OnUnRegistered(Context context, string registrationId)
        {
            throw new NotImplementedException();
        }

        protected override void OnError(Context context, string errorId)
        {
            System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(
                string.Format("Error occurred in the notification: {0}.", errorId));
        }

##<a id="update-scripts"></a>Update the registered insert script to send notifications

>[AZURE.NOTE] The following steps show you how to update the script registered to the insert operation on the TodoItem table in the Azure Management Portal. You can also access and edit this mobile service script directly in Visual Studio, in the Azure node of Server Explorer. 

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-javascript-backend-android-push-insert-script](../includes/mobile-services-javascript-backend-android-push-insert-script.md)]

##<a id="test"></a>Test push notifications in your app

You can test the app by directly attaching an Android phone with a USB cable, or by using a virtual device in the emulator.

###Setting up the Android emulator for testing
When you run this app in the emulator, make sure that you use an Android Virtual Device (AVD) that supports Google APIs.

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] In order to receive push notifications, you must set up a Google account on your Android Virtual Device (in the emulator, navigate to **Settings** and click **Add Account**). Also, make sure that the emulator is connected to the Internet.

1. From **Tools**, click **Open Android Emulator Manager**, select your device, and then click **Edit**.

   	![](./media/partner-xamarin-mobile-services-android-get-started-push/notification-hub-create-android-app7.png)

2. Select **Google APIs** in **Target**, then click **OK**.

   	![](./media/partner-xamarin-mobile-services-android-get-started-push/notification-hub-create-android-app8.png)

3. On the top toolbar, click **Run**, and then select your app. This starts the emulator and runs the app.

  The app retrieves the *registrationId* from GCM and registers with the Notification Hub.

###Inserting a new item generates a notification.

2. In the app, type meaningful text, such as _A new Mobile Services task_ and then click the **Add** button.

3. Swipe down from the top of the screen to open the device's Notification Center to see the notification.
