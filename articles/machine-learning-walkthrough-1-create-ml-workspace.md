# Step 1: Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace

To use Machine Learning Studio, you need to have a Microsoft Azure Machine Learning workspace. This workspace contains the tools you need to create, manage, and publish experiments.  

##To create a workspace  

1.	Sign in to your Microsoft Azure account.
2.	In the Microsoft Azure services panel, click **MACHINE LEARNING**.  
![Create workspace][1]

3.	Click **CREATE AN ML WORKSPACE**.
4.	On the **QUICK CREATE** page, enter your workspace information and then click **CREATE AN ML WORKSPACE**.

	> [AZURE.NOTE] The **WORKSPACE OWNER** is your Microsoft account (e.g., name@outlook.com) or organizational account.

After your Machine Learning workspace is created, you will see it listed on the **machine learning** page.  

> [AZURE.TIP] You can share the experiments you're working on by inviting others to your workspace. You can do this in Machine Learning Studio on the **SETTINGS** page. You just need the Microsoft account or organizational account for each user.
