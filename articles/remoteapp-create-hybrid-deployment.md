# How to create a hybrid collection for RemoteApp

There are two kinds of RemoteApp collections: 

- Cloud: resides completely in Azure and is created using the **Quick create** option in the Azure management portal.  
- Hybrid: includes a virtual network for on-premises access and is created using the **Create with VPN** option in the management portal.

This tutorial walks you through the process of creating a hybrid collection. There are seven steps: 

1.	Create a [custom template image for RemoteApp](remoteapp-create-custom-image.md).
2.	Create a RemoteApp collection.
2.	Link to a virtual network.
3.	Link a template image.
4.	Configure directory synchronization. RemoteApp requires that you integrate with Azure Active Directory by either 1) configuring Azure Active Directory Sync with the Password Sync option, or 2) configuring Azure Active Directory Sync without the Password Sync option but using a domain that is federated to AD FS. Check out the [configuration info for Active Directory with RemoteApp](remoteapp-ad.md).
5.	Publish RemoteApp apps.
6.	Configure user access.

**Before you begin**

You need to do the following before creating the collection:

- [Sign up](http://azure.microsoft.com/services/remoteapp/) for RemoteApp. 
- Create a user account in Active Directory to use as the RemoteApp service account. Restrict the permissions for this account so that it can only join machines to the domain.
- Gather information about your on-premises network: IP address information and VPN device details.
- Install the [Azure PowerShell](install-configure-powershell.md) module.
- Gather information about the users that you want to grant access to. This can be either Microsoft account information or Active Directory work account information.
- Create your template image. A RemoteApp template image contains the apps and programs that you want to publish for your users. See [How to create a custom template image for RemoteApp](remoteapp-create-custom-image.md) for detailed steps. 
- [Configure Active Directory for RemoteApp](remoteapp-ad.md).






## Step 1: Create a RemoteApp collection ##



1. In the [Azure Management Portal](http://manage.windowsazure.com), go to the RemoteApp page.
2. Click **New > Create with VPN**.
3. Enter a name for your collection.
4. Choose the plan that you want to use - standard or basic.
5. Click **Create RemoteApp collection**.

After your RemoteApp collection has been created, go to the RemoteApp **Quick Start** page to continue with the set up steps.

## Step 2: Link to a virtual network ##

A virtual network lets your users access data on your local network through RemoteApp remote resources. There are four steps to configure your virtual network link:

1. On the Quick Start page, click **link a remoteapp virtual network**. 
2. Choose whether to create a new virtual network or use an existing. For this tutorial, we'll create a new network.
3. Provide the following information for your new network:  
      - Name
      - Virtual network address space
      - Local address space
      - DNS server IP address
      - VPN IP address

	See [Configure a Site-to-Site VPN in the the Management Portal](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn133795.aspx) for more information.

4. Next, back on the Quick Start page, click **get script** to download a script to configure your VPN device to connect to the virtual network you just created. You'll need the following information about the VPN device: 
	- Vendor
	- Platform
	- Operating system

	Save the script and run it on the VPN device. 

	**Note:** After you run this script, the virtual network will move to the Ready state - this may take 5-7 minutes. Until the network is ready, you won't be able to use it.

5. Finally, again on the Quick Start page, click **join local domain**. Add the RemoteApp service account to your local Active Directory domain. You will need the domain name, organizational unit, service account user name and password. 

	This is the information you gathered if you followed the steps in [Configure Active Directory for Azure RemoteApp](remoteapp-ad.md).


## Step 3: Link to a RemoteApp template image ##

A RemoteApp template image contains the programs that you want to share with users. You can either upload the new template image you created (from the instructions in [How to create a custom template image for RemoteApp](remoteapp-create-custom-image.md)) or link to an existing image (one already uploaded to Azure). You can also link to [one of the images included with your subscription](remoteapp-images.md).

If you are uploading the new image, you need to enter the name and choose the location for the image. On the next page of the wizard, you'll see a set of PowerShell cmdlets - copy and run these cmdlets from an elevated Windows PowerShell prompt to upload the specified image.

If you are linking to an existing template image, simply specify the image name, location, and associated Azure subscription.



## Step 4: Configure Active Directory directory synchronization ##

RemoteApp requires that you integrate with Azure Active Directory by either 1) configuring Azure Active Directory Sync with the Password Sync option, or 2) configuring Azure Active Directory Sync without the Password Sync option but using a domain that is federated to AD FS. See [Directory synchronization roadmap](http://msdn.microsoft.com//library/azure/hh967642.aspx) for planning information and detailed steps.

## Step 5: Publish RemoteApp apps ##

A RemoteApp app is the app or program that you provide to your users. It is located in the template image you uploaded for the collection. When a user accesses an app, it appears to run in their local environment, but it is really running in Azure. 

Before your users can access RemoteApp apps, you need to publish them to the end-user feed – a list of available apps that your users access through the Remote Desktop client.
 
You can publish multiple apps to your RemoteApp collection. From the RemoteApp publishing page, click **Publish** to add an app. You can either publish from the Start menu of the template image or by specifying the path on the template image for the app. If you choose to add from the Start menu, choose the program to app. If you choose to provide the path to the app, provide a name for the app and the path to where it is installed on the template image.

## Step 6: Configure user access ##

Now that you have created your RemoteApp collection, you need to add the users that you want to be able to use your remote resources. The users that you provide access to need to exist in the Active Directory tenant associated with the subscription you used to create this RemoteApp collection.

1.	From the Quick Start page, click **Configure user access**. 
2.	Enter the work account (from Active Directory) or Microsoft account that you want to grant access for.

	**Notes:** 

	Make sure that you use the “user@domain.com” format.

	If you are using Office 365 ProPlus in your collection, you must use the Active Directory identities for your users. This helps validate licensing. 


3.	Once the users are validated, click **Save**.


## Next steps ##
That's it - you have successfully created and deployed your RemoteApp hybrid collection. The next step is to have your users download and install the Remote Desktop client. You can find the URL for the client on the RemoteApp Quick Start page. Then, have users log into the client and access the apps you published.
