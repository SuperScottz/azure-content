<!---Workflow can be confusing...have to select the correct size with **Browse all pricing tiers** then click Select on that pane and the **Recommended pricing tiers** pane to apply. But even after that, it didn't seem to pick the Premium storage account...showed up as 'standard GRS' when I inspected what type of storage account would be used for the VM.

This tutorial shows you how easy it is to create an Azure virtual machine (VM) running Windows, using as an example a Windows Server image from the Azure Marketplace in the Azure Preview Portal. The Marketplace offers a variety of images, including Windows operating systems, Linux-based operating systems, and application images. 

> [AZURE.NOTE] You don't need any experience with Azure VMs to finish this tutorial. However, you do need an Azure account. You can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see [Create an Azure account](http://www.windowsazure.com/develop/php/tutorials/create-a-windows-azure-account/). 

This tutorial shows you:

- [How to log on to the virtual machine after you create it](#logon)

This section shows you how to use the Preview Portal to create a VM, using Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter as an example. You can use Azure's default settings for most of the configuration and create the VM in just a few minutes.

> [AZURE.NOTE] The images available to you depends on your subscription. This tutorial uses a Windows Server image, but an MSDN subscription may offer additional images, including desktop images. 
 

1. Sign in to the [Azure Preview Portal](https://portal.azure.com). Check out the [Free Trial](http://www.windowsazure.com/pricing/free-trial/) offer if you don't have a subscription yet.

2. On the Hub menu, click **New**.

	![Select New from the Command Bar](./media/virtual-machines-windows-tutorial-azure-preview/new_button_preview_portal.png)

3. In the **New** blade, click **Everything**, click **Virtual machines**, click **Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter**, and then click **Create**.

	![Select a VM image from the Gallery](./media/virtual-machines-windows-tutorial-azure-preview/image_gallery_preview_portal.png)
	
4. On the **Create VM** blade, fill in the **Host Name** you want for the VM, the administrative **User Name**, and a strong **Password**.  

	>[AZURE.NOTE] **User Name** refers to the administrative account that you use to manage the server. Create a unique password for this account and make sure to remember it. **You'll need the user name and password to log on to the virtual machine**.
	

	![Configure host name and log on credentials](./media/virtual-machines-windows-tutorial-azure-preview/create_vm_name_pwd_preview_portal.png)
	
	
5. Review the default settings, such as the **Pricing Tier**, **Optional Configuration**, and **Location**. These choices affect the size of VM as well as networking options such as domain membership. For example, to try out Premium Storage on a virtual machine, you'll need to pick a region and size that supports it. 

	>[AZURE.NOTE] Premium storage is in Preview, available for DS-series virtual machines in certain regions. For details, see [Premium Storage: High-Performance Storage for Azure Virtual Machine Workloads](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/storage-premium-storage-preview-portal/).

	![Configure host name and log on credentials](./media/virtual-machines-windows-tutorial-azure-preview/create_vm_preview_portal.png)
	
6. When you're done reviewing or updating the settings, click **Create**.	

7. While Azure creates the VM, you can keep track of the progress in **Notifications**, in the Hub menu. After Azure creates the VM, you will see it on your Startboard.

	![VM appears on the Startboard](./media/virtual-machines-windows-tutorial-azure-preview/vm_startboard_preview_portal.png)

## <a id="logon"> </a>How to log on to the virtual machine after you create it ##

This section shows you how to log on to the VM so you can manage its settings and the applications that you'll run on it.

>[AZURE.NOTE] For requirements and troubleshooting tips, see [Connect to an Azure virtual machine with RDP or SSH](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=398294).

1. If you have not already done so, sign in to the [Azure Preview Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. Click your VM on the Startboard. If you need to find it, click **Browse** and then click **Virtual machines**. 

	![Browse to find the VM](./media/virtual-machines-windows-tutorial-azure-preview/browse_vm_preview_portal.png)

3. Then select your VM from the list. 

	![Select your VM name from the list](./media/virtual-machines-windows-tutorial-azure-preview/vm_select_preview_portal.png)

4. On the VM blade, click **Connect** at the top.

	![Log on to the virtual machine](./media/virtual-machines-windows-tutorial-azure-preview/connect_vm_preview_portal.png)

5. Click **Open** to use the Remote Desktop Protocol file that was automatically created for the virtual machine.
	
6. Click **Connect** to proceed with the connection process.

	![Continue with connecting](./media/virtual-machines-log-on-windows-server/connectpublisher.png)

7. Type the user name and password of the administrative account on the virtual machine, and then click **OK**.
	
8. Click **Yes** to verify the identity of the virtual machine.

	![Verify the identity of the machine](./media/virtual-machines-log-on-windows-server/connectverify.png)

	You can now work with the virtual machine just as you would with any other server.
