# What are Connectors and BizTalk API Apps

Azure App Services is built atop a principle of extensibility and common connectivity through API Apps. A *Connector* is a type of API App that focuses on connectivity. Connectors, like any other API App, are used from Web Apps, Mobile Apps, and Logic Apps. Connectors make it easy to connect to existing services and help manage authentication, provide monitoring, analytics, and more.

Any developer can create their own API Apps and deploy them privately, and in the future will be able to share and monetize them through the marketplace.

To accelerate developers building solutions with Azure App Services, the Microsoft Azure team added a number of connectors to the marketplace to satisfy many common scenarios. Furthermore, to extend the reach of App Services to complex and advanced integration scenarios, a number of Premium and BizTalk capabilities are also available.

## Protocol Connectors
App Services was born of the web and favors communication using HTTP and sharing metadata through open formats like Swagger. Of course, businesses need to communicate across a variety of protocols. The Protocol connectors can bridge the gap and make communicating with Services using FTP, SFTP, POP3/IMAP, SMTP, and SOAP services as easy as making an HTTP call.
