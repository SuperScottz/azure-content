##Use SSH with Linux-based Hadoop on HDInsight from Windows (Preview)

Linux-based HDInsight clusters provide the option of securing SSH access using either a password or an SSH key. This document provides information on connecting to HDInsight from Windows clients using the PuTTY SSH client.

> [AZURE.NOTE] The steps in this article assume you are using a Windows client. If you are using a Linux, Unix, or OS X client, see [Use SSH with Linux-based Hadoop on HDInsight from Linux, Unix, or OS X](/documentation/articles/hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-unix/).

##Prerequisites

* **PuTTY** and **PuTTYGen** for Windows clients. These utilities are available from <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html" target="_blank">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html</a>

* A modern web browser that supports HTML5

OR

* Azure PowerShell

OR

* Azure Cross-Platform Command-line Tools

##What is SSH?

SSH is a utility for logging in to, and remotely executing, commands on a remote server. With Linux-based HDInsight, SSH establishes a secure connection to the cluster head node and provides a command-line that you use to type in commands. Commands are then executed directly on the server.

##Create an SSH key (optional)

When creating a Linux-based HDInsight cluster, you have the option of using a password or SSH key to authenticate to the server when using SSH. SSH keys are considered more secure, as they are certificate-based. Use the following information if you plan on using SSH keys with your cluster.

1. Open **PuTTYGen**.

2. For **Type of key to generate**, select **SSH-2 RSA**, then click **Generate**.

	![PuTTYGen interface](./media/hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-windows/puttygen.png)

3. Move the mouse around in the area below the progress bar, until the bar fills. Moving the mouse generates random data that is used to generate the key.

	![moving the mouse around](./media/hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-windows/movingmouse.png)

	Once the key has been generated, the public key will be displayed.

4. For added security, you can enter a passphrase in the **Key passphrase** field, then type the same value in the **Confirm passphrase** field.

	![passphrase](./media/hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-windows/key.png)
	
	> [AZURE.NOTE] We strongly recommend that you use a secure passphrase for the key. However, if you forget the passphrase, there is no way to recover it.

5. Click **Save private key** to save the key to a **.ppk** file. This key will be used to authenticate to your Linux-based HDInsight cluster.

	> [AZURE.NOTE] You should store this key in a secure location, as it can be used to access your Linux-based HDInsight cluster.

6. Click **Save public key** to save the key as a **.txt** file. This allows you to reuse the public key in the future when you create additional Linux-based HDInsight clusters.

	> [AZURE.NOTE] The public key is also displayed at the top of **PuTTYGen**. You can right-click this field, copy the value, and then paste it into a form, such as the HDInsight wizard in the Azure Management Portal.

##Create a Linux-based HDInsight cluster

When creating a Linux-based HDInsight cluster, you must provide the **public key** created previously. From Windows clients, there are two ways to create a Linux-based HDInsight cluster:

* **Azure Management Portal** - uses a web-based portal to create the cluster

* **Azure Cross-Platform Command-Line Interface (xplat-cli)** - uses command-line commands to create the cluster

Each of these methods will require the **public key**. For complete information on creating an Linux-based HDInsight cluster see <a href="./hdinsight-hadoop-provision-linux-clusters/" target="_blank">Provision Linux-based HDInsight clusters</a>.

###Azure Management Portal

When using the portal to create a Linux-based HDInsight cluster, you must enter a username and password or public key into the following form.

![Image of form asking for public key](./media/hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-windows/ssh-key.png)

This creates a login for the specified user, and enables either password authentication or SSH key authentication.

###Azure Cross-Platform Command-Line Interface

You can use the <a href="../xplat-cli/" target="_brad">Azure Cross-Platform Command-Line Interface</a>, to create a new cluster using the `azure hdinsight cluzter create` command.

For more information on using this command, see <a href="../hdinsight-hadoop-provision-linux-clusters/" target="_blank">Provision Hadoop Linux clusters in HDInsight using custom options</a>

##<a id="connect"></a>Connect to a Linux-based HDInsight cluster

1. Open PuTTY.

	![putty interface](./media/hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-windows/putty.png)

2. If you provided an **SSH key** when you created your user account, you must perform the following step to select the **private key** to use when authenticating to the cluster.

	In **Category**, expand **Connection**, **SSH**, and select **Auth**. Finally, click **Browse** and select the **.ppk** that contains your **private key**.

	![putty interface, select private key](./media/hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-windows/puttykey.png)

3. In **Category**, select **Session**. From the **Basic options for your PuTTY session** screen, enter the SSH address of your HDInsight server in the **Host name (or IP address)** field. The SSH address is your cluster name, then **-ssh.azurehdinsight.net**. For example, **mycluster-ssh.azurehdinsight.net**.

	![putty interface with ssh address entered](./media/hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-windows/puttyaddress.png)

4. To save the connection information for future use, enter a name for this connection under **Saved Sessions**, then click **Save**. The connection will be added to the list of saved sessions.

5. Click **Open** to connect to the cluster.

	> [AZURE.NOTE] If this is the first time you have connected to the cluster, you will receive a security alert. This is normal - select **Yes** to cache the server's RSA2 key to continue.

6. When prompted, enter the user that you entered when you created the cluster. If you provided a **password** for the user, you will be prompted to enter it also.

##Add additional accounts

2. Generate a new **public key** and **private key** for the new user account as described previously.

1. From an SSH session to the cluster, add the new user with the following command.

		sudo adduser --disabled-password <username> 

	This will create a new user account, but will disable password authentication.

2. Create the directory and files to hold the key using the following commands.

		sudo mkdir -p /home/<username>/.ssh
		sudo touch /home/<username>/.ssh/authorized_keys
		sudo nano /home/<username>/.ssh/authorized_keys

3. When the nano editor opens, copy and paste in the contents of the **public key** for the new user account. Finally, use **Ctrl-X** to save the file and exit the editor.

	![image of nano editor with example key](./media/hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-windows/nano.png)

4. Use the following command to change ownership of the .ssh folder and contents to the new user account.

		sudo chown -hR <username>:<username> /home/<username>/.ssh

5. You should now be able to authenticate to the server with the new user account and **private key**.

##<a id="tunnel"></a>SSH Tunneling

SSH can also be used to tunnel local requests, such as web requests, to the HDInsight cluster. The request will then be routed to the requested resource as if it had originated on the HDInsight cluster head node.

This is most useful when accessing web-based services on the HDInsight cluster that use internal domain names for the head or worker nodes in the cluster. For example, some sections of the Ambari web page use internal domain names such as **headnode0.mycluster.d1.internal.cloudapp.net**. These names cannot be resolved from outside the cluster, however requests tunneled over SSH originate inside the cluster and will resolve correctly.

Use the following steps to create an SSH tunnel and configure your browser to use it to connect to the cluster.

1. Open PuTTY, and enter your connection information as documented in the [Connect](#connect) section.

2. In the **Category** section to the left of the dialog, expand **Connection**, **SSH**, and finally select **Tunnels**.

2. Provide the following information on the **Options controlling SSH port forwarding** form.

	* **Source port** - the port on the client that you wish to forward. For example, **9876**

	* **Destination** - the SSH address for the Linux-based HDInsight cluster. For example **mycluster-ssh.azurehdinsight.net**

	* **Dynamic** - enables dynamic SOCKS proxy routing

	![image of tunneling options](./media/hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-windows/puttytunnel.png)

3. Finally, select **Add** to add the settings, then select **Open** to open an SSH connection.

4. When prompted, login to the server. This will establish an SSH session and enable the tunnel.

2. Configure the client program, such as Firefox, to use **localhost:9876** as a **SOCKS v5** proxy. Here's what the Firefox settings look like.

	![image of Firefox settings](./media/hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-windows/socks.png)

	> [AZURE.NOTE] Selecting **Remote DNS** will resolve DNS requests using the HDInsight cluster. If unselected, DNS will be resolved locally.

	You can verify that traffic is being routed through the tunnel by vising a site such as <a href="http://www.whatismyip.com/" target="_blank">http://www.whatismyip.com/</a> with the proxy settings enabled and disabled in Firefox. While enabled, the IP address will be for a machine in the Microsoft Azure datacenter.

###Browser extensions

While configuring the browser to use the tunnel works, you don't usually want to route all traffic over the tunnel. Browser extensions such as <a href="http://getfoxyproxy.org/" target="_blank">FoxyProxy</a>  support pattern matching for URL requests (FoxyProxy Standard or Plus only,) so that only requests for specific URLs will be sent over the tunnel.

If you have installed **FoxyProxy Standard**, use the following steps to configure it to only forward traffic for HDInsight over the tunnel.

1. Open the FoxyProxy extension in your browser. For example, in Firefox, select the FoxyProxy icon next to the address field.

	![foxyproxy icon](./media/hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-windows/foxyproxy.png)

2. Select **Add New Proxy**, the **General** tab, and then enter a proxy name of **HDInsight**.

	![foxyproxy general](./media/hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-windows/foxygeneral.png)

3. Select the **Proxy Details tab** and populate the following fields.

	* **Host or IP Address** - localhost, since we are using an SSH tunnel on the local machine

	* **Port** - the port you used for the SSH tunnel

	* **SOCKS Proxy** - select this to enable the browser to use the tunnel as a proxy

	* **SOCKS v5** - Select this to set the required version for the proxy

	![foxyproxy proxy](./media/hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-windows/foxyproxyproxy.png)

4. Select the **URL Patterns** tab, then select **Add New Pattern**. Use the following to define the pattern, then click **OK**.

	* **Pattern Name** - **headnode** - this is just a friendly name for the pattern

	* **URL pattern** - **\*headnode\*** - this defines a pattern that matches any URL with the word **headnode** in it.

	![foxyproxy pattern](./media/hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-windows/foxypattern.png)

4. Select **Ok** to add the proxy and close the **Proxy Settings**

5. At the top of the FoxyProxy dialog, change **Select Mode** to **Use proxies based on their pre-defined patterns and priorities**, then select **Close**.

	![foxyproxy select mode](./media/hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-windows/selectmode.png)

After following these steps, only requests for URLs that contain the string **headnode** will be routed over the SSL tunnel.
