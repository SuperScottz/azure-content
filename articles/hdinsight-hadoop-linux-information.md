#Working with HDInsight on Linux (Preview)

Linux-based HDInsight clusters provide Hadoop on a familiar Linux environment, running in the Azure cloud. For most things, it should work exactly as any other Hadoop on Linux installation. This document calls out specific differences that you should be aware of.

##Domain names

The Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) to use when connecting to the cluster is **&lt;clustername>.azurehdinsight.net** or (for SSH only) **&lt;clustername>.aurehdinsight.net**.

##Services accessible remotely

* **Ambari (web)** - https://&lt;clustername>.azurehdinsight.net

	> [AZURE.NOTE] Authenticate using the cluster administrator user and password, then login to Ambari. This also uses the cluster administartor user and password
	>
	> Authentication is plaintext - always use HTTPS to ensure the connection is secure.

	While Ambari for your cluster is accessible directly over the Internet, some functionality relies on accessing nodes by the internal domain name used by the cluster. Since this is an internal domain name, and not public, you will receive server not found errors when trying to access some features over the Internet.

	To work around this problem, use an SSH tunnel to proxy web traffic to the cluster head node. Use the following articles to create an SSH tunnel from a port on your local machine to the cluster.

	* <a href="../hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-unix/#tunnel" target="_blank">Use SSH with Linux-based Hadoop on HDInsight from Linux, Unix, or OS X</a> - stpes on creating an SSH tunnel using the `ssh` command

	* <a href="../hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-windows/#tunnel" target="_blank">Use SSH with Linux-based Hadoop on HDInsight from Windows</a> - steps on using Putty to create an SSH tunnel

* **Ambari (REST)** - https://&lt;clustername>.azurehdinsight.net/ambari

	> [AZURE.NOTE] Authenticate using the cluster administrator user and password.
	>
	> Authentication is plaintext - always use HTTPS to ensure the connection is secure.

* **WebHCat (Templeton)** - https://&lt;clustername>.azurehdinsight.net/templeton

	> [AZURE.NOTE] Authenticate using the cluster administrator user and password.
	>
	> Authentication is plaintext - always use HTTPS to ensure the connection is secure.

* **SSH** - &lt;clustername>-ssh.azurehdinsight.net on port 22

	> [AZURE.NOTE] You can only access the cluster head node through SSH from a client-machine. Once connected, you can then access the worker nodes using SSH from the head node.

##File locations

Hadoop related files can be found on the cluster nodes at `/usr/hdp/current`.

Example data and jars can be found on HDFS (WASB) at '/example' or 'wasb:///example'.

##HDFS, WASB, and storage best practices

In most Hadoop distributions, the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is backed by local storage on the machines in the cluster. While this is efficient, it can be costly for a cloud-based solution where you are charged hourly for compute resources.

HDInsight uses Azure Blob Storage as the default store, which provides the following benefits:

* Cheap long term storage

* Accessible from external services such as websites, file upload/download utilities, various language SDKs, and web browsers

Since it is the default store for HDInsight, you normally don't have to do anything to use it. For example, the following command will list files in the **/example/data** folder, which is stored on Azure Blob Storage.

	hadoop fs -ls /example/data

Some commands may require you to specify that you are using Blob Storage. For these, you can prefix the command with **WASB://**.

HDInsight also allows you to associate multiple Blob Storage accounts with a cluster. To access data on a non-default Blob storage account, you can use the format **WASB://&lt;container-name>@&lt;account-name>.blob.core.windows.net/**. For example, the following will list the contents of the **/example/data** directory for the specified container and storage account.

	hadoop fs -ls wasb://mycontainer@mystorage.blob.core.windows.net/example/data

###What blob storage is the cluster using?

During cluster creation, you select to use either an existing storage account and container, or to create a new one. Then, you probably forgot about it. You can find the storage account and container using the following methods.

**Azure Portal**

1. In the <a href="https://manage.windowsazure.com/" target="_blank">Azure management portal</a>, select your HDInsight cluster.

2. Select **Dashboard** at the top of the page.

3. The storage account(s) and container(s) are listed in the **linked resources** section of the page.

**Azure Cross-Platform Command-Line Interface**

*Comming soon!*

###How do I access blob storage?

Other than through the Hadoop command from the cluster, there are a variety of ways to access blobs:

* <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/xplat-cli/" target="_blank">Azure Cross-Platform Command-Line Interface</a> - after installing see `azure storage` for help on using storage, or `azure blob` for blob specific commands.

* A variety of SDKs:

	* <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java" target="_blank">Java</a>

	* <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-node" target="_blank">Node.js</a>

	* <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-php" target="_blank">PHP</a>

	* <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python" target="_blank">Python</a>

	* <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby" target="_blank">Ruby</a>

	* <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net" target="_blank">.NET</a>

* <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dd135733.aspx" target="_blank">Storage REST API</a>
